# IEEEHacksML-DL

## üî¥ Hola contributors!:yellow_circle:
Welcome to the OpenSource Event for IEEE Hacks 2022! This repository aims to be the hub of various ML projects which will be the resources for your fellow ML enthusiasts!

## Structure of the Projects üìù
This repository consists of various machine learning projects, and all of the projects must follow a certain template. We hope all contributors will take care of this while contributing in this repository. <br><br>
Whilst contributing any project, make sure it internally contains the following: 
**Dataset Folder** - This folder stores the dataset used in this project. If the Dataset is not being able to uploaded in this folder due to the large size, then put a README.md file inside the Dataset folder and put the link of the collected dataset in it. That'll work!<br><br>
**Images Folder** - This folder is used to store the images generated during the data analysis, data visualization, data segmentation of the project.<br><br>
**Model Folder** - This folder would have your:<br>
- project file (that is .ipynb file) be it analysis or prediction. 
- 'README.md' explaining the goal of the project, some introduction of the dataset and its link, accuracy and your name 
- requirements.txt' file which would be enclosed with all needed add-ons and libraries that are included in the project.
